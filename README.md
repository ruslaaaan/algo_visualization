## Algorithm visualizer

An algorithm visualizer application for Sort and Search algorithms, built with React,  Typescript, Jest, and CSS.



## Project Status

The project is currently in development. 

Users can run algorithms in Single or Compare Modes. 

Pathfinding algorithms will be added.

## ****Reflection****

The purpose of this project was to learn more about React state management, the use of time-based functions inside React, and algorithms implementation.

It was a great learning experience. 

It is the first thing I build apart from learning tutorial projects, so I learned a lot. So, I approached it in exploration mode and tried to figure things out independently.

I also tried to squeeze from learning maximum potential, so I challenged myself at each step I progress:

Once, I build it with Javascript, I then started to learn Typescript and re-build it with it.

Then I  learned Redux and added it, but after that, I returned to simple React Context. 
And after I learned and added Jest.

Despite the fact that it is a time-consuming process, I gained a deeper understanding of React and algorithms, develop an appreciation of best practices, and learned to deal with frustration and unknown, hence greater confidence in my own abilities
